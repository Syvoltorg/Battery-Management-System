# SOC Estimation with Efficiency Comparison

This MATLAB project estimates the **State of Charge (SOC)** of a battery under variable load and compares the efficiency of a user-defined speed profile with an optimal speed profile.

## Features
- Dynamically calculates SOC over time for both user and optimal profiles.
- Estimates battery efficiency as a percentage based on runtime comparison.
- Visualizes SOC trends, efficiency metrics, and speed profiles.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2020b or later.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syvoltorg/SOC Estimation under variable load with weight and speed.m
   cd SOC Estimation under variable load with weight and speed.m

# SOC Estimation Project

This MATLAB project estimates the **State of Charge (SOC)** of a battery under variable load conditions influenced by total weight and user-defined speed profiles.

## Features
- Dynamically calculates SOC over time based on speed and load.
- User inputs either a constant or variable speed profile.
- Visualizes SOC trends, speed profiles, and time to full discharge.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2020b or later.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SOC_Estimation_Project.git
   cd SOC_Estimation_Project
